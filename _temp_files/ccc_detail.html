      <h1>Bido <em>from guide to guru, the integration of children – and generations – into colonial societies</em>
</h1>

    <h2 id="Abstract">Abstract</h2>
    
    
    
    <p>In colonial societies, children played important intermediary and brokering roles between coloniser and the colonised, often veering between different societal groups.<br>A telling example concerns a Marind man Bido <sup><a href="#footnote_0_24" id="identifier_0_24" class="footnote-link footnote-identifier-link" title="The name is spelled as both ‘Bido’ and ‘Bidoe’ in the sources. For consistency, I have opted to use the name Bido throughout this vignette.">1</a></sup> , who as a young teenager had served as guide during the government explorations of South-East Dutch New Guinea in 1905. Around 1910, he started to live with the Missionaries of Sacred Heart (MSC) in Merauke. Various photographs and documents attest to his life as one of their first local trustees and helpers. Bido’s life course shows how generations of cross-cultural intermediaries came into being.</p>

    <p>I first came across Bido in a collection of photographs taken for the purpose of anthropological research by the Missionaries of the Sacred Heart (MSC) on Dutch New Guinea. At first sight, the photograph stood out because of the unusual scene it depicted. In a collection of photographs where most of the people were posing rigidly and with serious expressions on their faces, two smiling and seemingly relaxed boys attract attention. Although the location where the photograph was taken is the same as some of the more ethnographical pictures, namely the backyard<sup><a href="#footnote_0_21" id="identifier_0_21" class="footnote-link footnote-identifier-link" title="The name is spelled as both ‘Bido’ and ‘Bidoe’ in the sources. For consistency, I have opted to use the name Bido throughout this vignette.">2</a></sup> of the mission station in Merauke, the picture is far more informal. The posture of the boys is relaxed but confident and their smiling looks in the lens of the camera give the photograph a personal feel. The dog awkwardly propped up in the boy’s arms enhances the laid-back atmosphere and strengthens the perception of looking at a portrait of two individuals, rather than two ‘types’.</p>
    
    
    
    <p>Upon closer inspection, the photograph stood out even more: it was the first photograph in the collection of someone of the Marind-anim tribe whose name was mentioned in the caption. And not just his name, but also his significance to the MSC: ‘Marind boys – with dog is Bido – head of the first group to be baptised’ <sup><a href="#footnote_1_24" id="identifier_1_24" class="footnote-link footnote-identifier-link" title="ENK, AR-P027-20153. ‘Marind jongens – met hond is Bido – hoofd eerste groep gedooptes’.">3</a></sup>.</p>
    
    
    
    <p>In the August of 1905, four Dutch Missionaries of the Sacred Heart of Jesus (Latin: Missionarii Sacratissimi Cordis or MSC) arrived in Merauke, a military post on the south coast of Dutch New Guinea that had been established just a few years earlier. Most sources on Bido’s life can be found in their archive. Two albums in the collection were almost exclusively dedicated to the anthropological photographs made by father H. Nollen between 1906 and 1909, inventory numbers 20152 and 20153 in the archive. The albums are titled ‘Original inhabitants of the south coast of New Guinea, the Marind tribe around 1910’. Together, they contain approximately 150 photographs. The picture of Bido can be found in album 20153. This album was most likely composed by Father Nico Verhoeven (1896-1981, in New Guinea 1923-1935), as his signature can be found on the flyleaf. The albums are similar in both content and style, almost exclusively containing pictures of Marind-anim posing on the mission grounds or occasionally a beach village, accompanied by plain captions simply stating ‘Marind man 1910’, ‘Marind women 1910’, ‘Marind girls’.</p>
    
    
    
    <p>In the context of an album which had clearly been put together at least several years after the photographs had been taken and where most pictures were accompanied by very non-specific and even erroneous descriptions, this indicated that Bido stayed with the missionaries for a long period of time – from this first picture which was taken around 1906 at least until after Verhoeven arrived in 1923. And indeed, Bido turns up several more times in the collection of photographs taken between 1906 and 1935. How did he get acquainted with the Catholic mission in the colonial settlement of Merauke and how did he end up being among the first to be baptised?</p>
    
    
    
    <p>Although we first encountered Bido as an acquaintance of the MSC missionaries around 1906, this was not his first encounter with Dutch colonialism. In their letters, the missionaries describe how Bido had acted as a guide during the 1904/1905 exploration tour lead by the Royal Dutch Geographical Society (Koninklijk Nederlands Aardrijkskundig Genootschap). The official report of this expedition, however, repeatedly states that there were no Papuan people involved in the exploration, as they were considered too ‘uncivilised’. Nevertheless, Bido ís mentioned in the report, but not in the text: his name is included in the list of measurements of ‘men’, among which he constitutes number 46 out of 46 in total. However, with a height of 1.55 meter he is by far the shortest amongst the men. Additionally, his measurements are incomplete: the column indicating the estimate age is left empty, as are most of the measurements which required specific instruments. Of the sixteen children (one girl, fifteen boys) whose measurements were recorded, the average height of a twelve-year-old boy was 1.52 meter. This supports the idea that Bido was a boy in his early teens involved with the exploration tour in some way, whose data was haphazardly recorded and used to somewhat substantiate the humble data set. This example is telling because it shows how young Papuan people were quite literally reduced to a ‘curiosity’, passive data to be ‘explored’ and ‘collected’, instead of being acknowledged as contributors to colonial enterprises.</p>
    
    
    
    <p>He is significantly shorter than most.</p>
    
    
    
    <p>Although we know he was involved with the expedition, presumably as a young teenager, his exact role in the expedition remains a silence.<br>More information might be found in the expedition archives in the National Archive in The Hague, or in personal diaries/archives of the other expedition members.</p>
